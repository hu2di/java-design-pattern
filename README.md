I'm learning design pattern by myself :)))

### 23 Patterns
1. Creational
- Abstract factory pattern: groups object factories that have a common theme.
- Builder pattern: constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
- Factory method pattern: creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
- Prototype pattern: creates objects by cloning an existing object.
- Singleton pattern: restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.

2. Structural
- Adapter: allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
- Bridge: decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- Composite: composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
- Decorator: dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object.
- Facade: provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
- Flyweight: reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- Proxy: provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.

3. Behavioral
- Chain of responsibility: delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
- Command: creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
- Interpreter: implements a specialized language.
- Iterator: accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- Mediator: allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
- Memento: provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).
- Observer: is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
- State: allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- Strategy: allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.
- Template method: defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
- Visitor: separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.

- Mediator: một lớp ở giữa liên kết các thành phần hay trao đổi dữ liệu với nhau
- Adapter: chuyển đổi oldObj sang newObj
- Proxy: giả lập tương tác cục bộ thay cho từ xa
- Observer: đăng ký với hệ thống để lắng nghe sự thay đổi

- Strategy: bỏ các phương thức hay thay đổi ra khỏi lớp, tạo thành một tập các giải thuật riêng

- Decorator
- Factory
